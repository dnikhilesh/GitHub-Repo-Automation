# Automate Initializing a new Repository on GitHub

I found it extremely tedious to repeat the same tasks over and over again to create and initialize a **new** repository.

To tackle this problem, I wrote a python script using Selenium to navigate through the GitHub page to create and initialize a new Repository for you.


Prerequisites:
1. Selenium

    To install: ```pip install selenium```

2. Chrome Browser
3. Chrome Driver for Selenium
    
     To install, visit: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and choose appropriate driver.
    


## To get started [CreateWithSelenium.py]

  1. Clone this Repo using the git clone command
  
    git clone https://github.com/ferran9908/GitHub-Repo-Management.git/
    
  2. Add your username and password in the Create.py script and change the path to your favorite directory.
  
  3. Change the .gitscript.sh file to point to your directory and change the username to your GitHub username.
  
  4. Rename file to Create.py
  
  5. Copy both files to root directory.
  
  6. Run the shell script first.
      
      ```source ~/.gitscript.sh```
  
  7. **DONE SETTING UP**
